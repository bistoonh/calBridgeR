Description: Provides functions for fast and accurate conversion between Jalali (Persian), Gregorian, and Hijri dates 
    using a precomputed lookup table. Includes utilities to normalize date strings, convert dates across calendars, 
    generate sequences of dates, and compute differences in days or date-time values. Designed for high performance 
    with large datasets, using data.table when available and falling back to hash-based lookup otherwise.
